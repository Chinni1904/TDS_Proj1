## GitHub Users in Basel Analysis

- This project analyzes GitHub users from Basel with over 10 followers and their repositories using the GitHub API.
- I scraped user data, including follower counts, repository details, and programming languages to understand developer trends.
- My findings can help developers choose the right programming language and understand the local developer community.

## Data Scraping Explanation
I used the GitHub API to gather data on users based in Basel, filtering for those with more than 10 followers. Each user's repositories were then fetched, including details such as the number of stars, programming language, and license information.

## Interesting Findings
I have discovered that most of the users from 2020 have preferred using Python as their programming. 

## Actionable Recommendation
I recommend that developers focus on the most popular programming languages in Basel when contributing to local projects. This can enhance collaboration and ensure that their contributions align with the community's needs and preferences.
